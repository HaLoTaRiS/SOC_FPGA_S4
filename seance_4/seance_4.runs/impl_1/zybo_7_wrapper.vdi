WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net zybo_7_i/macc_ip_0/U0/macc_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/reg_data_out_reg[31]_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin zybo_7_i/macc_ip_0/U0/macc_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/reg_data_out_reg[31]_i_2/O, cell zybo_7_i/macc_ip_0/U0/macc_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/reg_data_out_reg[31]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
